== About ==

The 240p Test Suite
has two goals:

1. Evaluate TV sets and
   video processors for
   ability to handle retro
   console video signals.
2. Turn a Super NES or
   GameCube into a test
   signal generator to help
   in calibrating the black,
   white, and color levels
   of a display.
----
The Game Boy outputs a
progressive video signal
with 144 lines of picture.
The original Game Boy and
Game Boy Pocket have
a passive matrix STN
LCD panel that displays
four shades of gray.
The Super Game Boy
accessory maps these
gray shades to colors.
The Game Boy Color has
a TFT panel with 32
levels per RGB channel.
----
Press Start in any test
pattern to show help for
that pattern.

The test suite is also
available for several
other consoles.

== Grid ==

This grid uses the
screen's full resolution.
Use it to verify that
the entire picture is
visible, including the
shaded border, with
no distortion.

Select: Invert grays

== Linearity ==

This pattern shows five
circles at the square
pixel aspect ratio of
the Game Boy screen.

Use it to verify the
horizontal to vertical
size ratio setting of your
display or scaler or to
verify the lack of barrel
distortion of a CRT.
----
On handhelds and
Game Boy Player, the
circles should have the
same diameter in all
directions. Super Game
Boy stretches them
horizontally by 14%
on NTSC or 38% on PAL.

A: Hide or show grid
Select: Invert grays

== Gray ramp ==

Use this pattern to
check color balance.
This gray ramp should
not have a red, green,
or blue tint to it. On
Game Boy or Game Boy
Pocket, four shades
should be distinct.

Cheap color LCDs may
have different gamma
curves per component.

== Solid screen ==

Some displays and
scalers have problems
with sudden changes
between deep black
and a white screen.
Other displays may have
stuck or damaged pixels.

←→: Change gray level
  or color
A on white: Hide or show
  RGB input (GBC/SGB)
↑↓←→: Change RGB value
----
Poor high-voltage
regulation in a CRT
causes image size to
depend on brightness.
This changes border
width on Super Game Boy
or Game Boy Player.

== Motion blur ==

This tests how quickly
an LCD reacts to
changes in gray level
by toggling a square
between two shades.
Use it with a high-speed
camcorder, or set the
shades the same to
check gray levels.

↑↓: Choose a setting
←→: Change its value
A: Start or stop the test
----
The STN display in the
original Game Boy and
Game Boy Pocket has
a fairly slow response,
which blurs fast motion.
Game Boy Color's TFT
dramatically improves
response time.
All Game Boy displays
have an interlace-like
effect, drawing even
or odd lines darker
in alternate frames.
----
STN smearing:

Passive matrix LCDs in
Game Boy and especially
Game Boy Pocket have
artifacts. Because there's
no transistor to block
crosstalk from other
lines of pixels, the image
on each line leaks a
fraction into other lines.
Dark areas end up with
vertical stripes above
and below them.

== Sharpness ==

Set the sharpness of
your TV to a value that
shows clean black and
gray transitions without
white ghost lines on
the side.

Select: Invert grays
A: Toggle brick wall
----
Modern TVs' "sharpness"
control performs edge
enhancement, intended
for live action SDTV or
VHS sources.
Most TVs have zero as
no change and high as
enhancement. A few have
middle as no change,
high as enhancement,
and low as blurring.

== Overscan ==

With this pattern you
can discover how much
of the picture edge your
Game Boy's lens hides.

The LCD is slightly
recessed in the chassis.
This can block light from
reaching the screen's
edges depending on the
angle of the light source.
----
↑↓←→: Choose an edge
Hold A + ↑↓←→:
  Move that edge

Move each edge inward
until you see the border,
then go back one pixel.
Or leave one border pixel
visible and subtract 1.
The result is the amount
of overscan in pixels in
each direction.

== Shadow sprite ==

This test draws a shadow
sprite on every other
frame, flickering at
30 Hz. Many games use
such flicker to show
transparency.

Some deinterlacers show
drop shadows OK but
still interpret 240p as
480i. The striped sprite
should make attempted
deinterlacing easy
to spot.
----
↑↓←→: Move sprite
A: Skip flicker frame
  or rotate stripes
A+↑: Change shadow type
  (flicker or stripes)
A+←→: Change background
Select: Change shape

These shouldn't happen:
- Background loses detail
- Shadow disappears
- Thin horizontal stripes
  in flicker pattern
----
Handhelds' LCD driver
circuits use a technique
similar to interlacing
to improve pixel
response time.

== Stopwatch ==

This stopwatch helps
you measure a TV's lag,
detect dropped frames,
or just count how long
your spouse has been
on the phone.

A: Start or stop
Select stopped: Reset
Select running: Lap
↑: Change ruler at left
   (show, hide, or blink)
↓: Hide or show
   inactive circles
----
The clock face below
helps determine the
frame even when the
numbers above are
blurry.

The stopwatch assumes
60 Hz. This means it
runs slightly slow on a
handheld (1 part in 219)
or more noticeably fast
on Super Game Boy
(1 part in 51).
----
To measure lag, get a
camera and connect two
TVs to one Super NES.
One is being tested, and
the other (the reference)
should be a CRT SDTV or
a display with known lag.
For example, connect
a CRT to RF out and
your scaler to AV out.
----
Then photograph both
screens at once.
The picture will show the
difference in processing
latency between them.
Some consumer LCD TVs
exceed five frames.

The ruler helps count
scanlines of lag. Use a
short exposure on your
camera and divide lines by
15.7 to get milliseconds.
----
Tests on Super Game Boy
should be repeated
several times because
SGB drops a lot of
frames. It runs the GB
at 61.18 Hz but itself
outputs video at 60.10
Hz, dropping one frame
in 57. A scaler in turn
drops one frame in 345
or 607 depending on
59.94 or 60.00 Hz output.

== Manual lag test ==

This helps quantify a
display's processing lag
by showing a changing
pattern on the screen,
optionally with audio.

Press A when the moving
and still reticles align
to display the offset in
frames from the actual
intersection and whether
it was early or late. After
ten non-early presses,
their average is shown.
----
↑↓: Choose a setting
←→: Change its value

Settings include the
direction of the moving
reticle (horizontal,
vertical, or both),
whether to randomize
timing of movement, and
whether to beep when A
is pressed or beep and
flash when the reticles
align.

== Hill zone scroll test ==

This shows a scrolling
background with several
parallax strips. It can
be used to notice any
drops in frame rate.

↑↓: Change speed
←→: Change direction
A: Stop or start

== Vertical scroll test ==

This test shows a
scrolling background.
Use it to measure
cadence detection in a
deinterlacer or test
hypotheses about
handheld "interlacing".

↑↓: Change speed
←→: Change direction
A: Start or stop

== Grid scroll test ==

A grid scrolls vertically
or horizontally. This can
be used to test linearity
and how well the display
copes with scrolling and
frame rate. Some scalers
may produce a still image
at maximum speed.

↑↓: Change speed
A: Start or stop
A + ↑↓←→:
  Change direction
Select: Invert grays

== Full screen stripes ==

You should see a
pattern of lines,
each one pixel wide.

↑↓←→: Move the
  pattern by one pixel
Hold: Move every frame
A: Switch among
  horizontal, vertical,
  and checkerboard
Select: Show or hide
  frame counter
----
While you hold Up, the
lines should flicker.
If holding Up makes a
still image, your scaler
is treating the signal
as interlaced and either
discarding every other
frame or weaving them
incorrectly.
If holding Up makes
a solid gray image,
you're probably seeing
slow LCD response time.

== Backlight zone test ==

This test displays a
small moving square,
letting you check how
a display works with
small bright areas.
Some LED-lit LCDs dim
dark areas to make
blacks deeper, which
causes problems with
scenes such as
starfields and credits.
----
↑↓←→: Move the square
A: Hide or show square
A+↑↓: Change its size
  among 1, 2, 4, or 8
  pixels on a side
Select: Invert grays

== Sound test: Frequency ==

8000 Hz
4000 Hz
2000 Hz
1000 Hz
500 Hz
250 Hz
125 Hz
62 Hz
1000 Hz left
1000 Hz right
1000 Hz (pulse)
Hiss noise
Buzz noise

== Sound test ==

Use this test to ensure
that the audio output
works and that audio and
video are synchronized.

A: Play a sound and
  flash the screen

The Game Boy has stereo
audio output. Each voice
(pulse 1, pulse 2,
wavetable, and noise)
can be panned hard left,
center, or hard right.
----
Most options in the menu
use the wavetable with
an approximate sine wave.
It has a prominent
overtone 5 octaves up.

The CPU generates noise
with a polynomial counter
that can operate in two
modes: hiss (32767 steps)
or buzz (127 steps).

== Audio sync test ==

This test flashes the
whole screen for two
frames along with a
1 kHz test tone when
the dot hits the floor.

You can verify the sync
between audio and video
with recording equipment
or an oscilloscope.

A: Start or stop the test

== Lame boy ==

This test served as a
placeholder in early
versions of 144p Test
Suite for tests that had
not yet been ported to
Game Boy. It's still cute.

== Color tests: Menu ==

PLUGE
Gradient color bars
SMPTE color bars
Color bars on gray
Color bleed

== Color tests ==

These patterns measure
color balance on
Game Boy Color or
Super Game Boy.
They do not work on
original Game Boy or
Game Boy Pocket.

== PLUGE ==

The PLUGE (picture
line-up generation
equipment) pattern is
used to adjust the TV's
"brightness" or black
level. Adjust it until
the outer bar is barely
visible.

A: Toggle levels between
  NTSC and NTSC-J
Select: Open PLUGE
  Contrast
----
The 32 shades on
SGB and GBC should
correspond to signal level
steps of about 3.2 IRE.
(This needs further
testing.) This would put
shade 0 at NTSC-J black
(0 IRE) and shade 2 near
NTSC's 7.5 IRE setup.

NTSC: shades 3 and 0
  on background 2
NTSC-J: shades 1 and 0.5
  on background 0
----
The PLUGE Contrast
sub-test fills the screen
with a pattern based on
the SHARK (U+1F988)
emoji. Use it with various
palettes to check
contrast and brightness.

A: Switch palette among
  color, dark, darker,
  light, or lighter
Select: Return to PLUGE

== Gradient color bars ==

This pattern lets you
calibrate red, green,
and blue colors on
your TV. Increase the
"contrast" until C and
E in the white ramp
look the same, then
decrease it slowly until
you can tell them apart.

A: Hide or show grid

== SMPTE color bars ==

Use this pattern to
calibrate for NTSC
levels regarding
contrast, brightness,
and colors. With some
displays, you can use
blue-only mode to
confirm color balance.
Based on SMPTE
EG 1-1990

A: Toggle brightness
  (75% or 100%)
Select: Play 1 kHz tone

== Color bars on gray ==

This pattern shows
color bars on a gray
background. Use it with
color filters to adjust
color balance.
Based on Digital Video
Essentials: HD Basics

A: Toggle brightness
  (75% or 100%)
Select: Play 1 kHz tone

== Color bleed ==

This pattern helps
diagnose color bleed
caused by incorrect
color resampling.

Chroma crosstalk

== Chroma crosstalk ==

This pattern shows
colored stripes arranged
to show crosstalk
between the luma and
chroma of the composite
video output of an
NTSC Super NES.

On composite, "NTSC"
fades in and out.
Through S-Video or RGB,
the stripes are indistinct.
----
The S-ENC or S-RGB chip
encodes the PPU's RGB
output to composite video,
taking shortcuts to save
cost. Because it doesn't
filter chroma before
adding it to luma, diagonal
lines and checkerboard
patterns often produce
crosstalk artifacts.

The fraction (2950000/2128137) â‰ˆ 1.386188953 appears in the pixel
aspect ratio (PAR) of several digital picture generators that
generate a PAL-compatible signal.  A system containing this fraction
is far more difficult to reason about than the 8/7 of NTSC and tricky
to even approximate because of all the small numbers in its finite
continued fraction expansion.  There are 10 terms before the first
greater than 3.

def eval_cf(terms):
    """Convert the terms of a finite continued fraction to a fraction.

A continued fraction is a number of the form
a[0] + 1/(a[1] + 1/(a[2] + 1/(a[3] + ...)))

Example:
The terms of the continued fraction for math.pi begin
[3;7,15,1,292,1,1,1,2,1,3,1,...]
You can get a reasonable-for-length approximation by cutting the
fraction before a high number: [3,7,15,1]
eval_cf([3,7,15,1]) = (355, 113) where 355/113 approximates math.pi

If the last term is 1, you may truncate it and add 1 to the remaining last term
eval_cf([3,7,16]) also equals (355, 113)

With pixel aspect ratios, it's often helpful to pick a convergent
whose numerator or denominator divides 72 to make the DPI setting
for paint programs easier to remember.  Hence 18/13 for PAL H32,

These assets in upstream 240p Test Suite were replaced to keep the
software free.

- Gillian  
  Was a drawing of Gillian Seed resembling the [opening cut scene]
  from Konami's _SD Snatcher_.  Replaced with Gus, who first appeared
  in _LOCKJAW Tetromino Game_ and _LJ65_.
- Motoko  
  Was Maj. Motoko Kusanagi from Masamune Shirow's
  _Ghost in the Shell_.  Replaced with another illustration of
  Gus by darryl.revok.  (In fourth quarter 2021, upstream replaced
  it with Donna, and GB followed suit.)
- Hepsie  
  Was a badnik from Sega's _Sonic the Hedgehog_.  Replaced with a
  fairy godmother character from a discarded Apple II game design.
- Scroll test  
  Was Green Hill Zone from _Sonic_.  Replaced with a lookalike by
  Michael Moffitt and Damian Yerrick.
- Vertical scroll test  
  Tile set was from Taito's _KiKi KaiKai_.  Replaced with original
  tiles with similar textures.
- PLUGE Shark  
  From Toaplan's _Fire Shark_.  Replaced with a pastiche of
  the appearance of the Shark (U+1F988) emoji in Google Noto
  and Twitter Twemoji.

[M. Culbuto] and [nevalyashka dolls] are almost a match for Gus's
body shape.  Aerialist Jen Bricker, skateboarder Kanya Sesser, and
photographer Kevin Michael Connolly are even better matches.

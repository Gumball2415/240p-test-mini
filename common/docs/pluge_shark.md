PLUGE Shark
===========

The Pluge Contrast test in 240p Test Suite (for Sega Genesis) version
1.16 displays a [32x32-pixel shark head mascot][1] from Toaplan's
game _Fire Shark_ as a repeating pattern.  When I discovered that
we probably don't have the rights to this icon, I drew my own
replacement based on the pose used by emoji fonts' renderings
of the character ðŸ¦ˆ [SHARK (U+1F988)][2], added in Unicode 11.
I made a bit more cartoonish, including a large eye like those
of the icon, and colored it based on the closest color in the
[Bisqwit palette on wiki.nesdev.com][3] to each color in the icon.

* Outline: #000000 (NES $0F)
* Background mark: #003C00 (NES $0A)
* Background space: #077704 (NES $1A)
* Shark body: #131F7F (NES $02)
* Shark underbody: #00727D (NES $1C)
* Shark eye and teeth: #AEAEAE (NES $10)
* Tongue (not used): #BD3C30 (NES $16)

Though I give NES equivalents for all seven colors, I ended up not
drawing a visible tongue.  And on 2bpp platforms (NES and GB), the
background mark and space will have to share colors with the shark.

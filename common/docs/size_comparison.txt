Why are some bigger on NES?
* VWF: Probably code density for 16-bit operations
* Layout: NES attribute tables are painful, among other things
* Decompression: Nametables are packed tighter (for bigger screen), and special handling for 1bpp tiles.
* Some tests don't exist on GB, such as Overclock, Crosstalk, Zapper, and Crowd.
* Linearity: The circles cover nearly twice as much circumference, and there are two of them (NTSC and PAL).
* Sharpness: Again, more diameter.
* Help text: Help pages for tests that don't exist on GB don't exist on GB either
* Overscan: NES lacks anything like GB "window" for drawing two of the edges. Instead a background update must be prepared.
* Stopwatch: Antialiasing on clock face
* Manual lag test: The DDR-style grades

Some tests are bigger on GB.
* Shadow sprite: Two Gus portraits with antialiasing vs. one (slightly larger) portrait without
* Sound test: Wave RAM.
* Lame boy doesn't exist

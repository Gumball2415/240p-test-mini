== About ==

The 240p Test Suite
has two goals:

1. Evaluate TV sets and
   video processors for
   ability to handle retro
   console video signals.
2. Turn a game console into
   a test signal generator
   to help in calibrating the
   black, white, and color
   levels of a display.
----
The Game Boy Advance
system outputs 160 lines of
progressive video.
Its TFT LCD has 32 levels
per RGB channel and a
reputation for crushing black
levels, for which its launch
titles failed to compensate.
Game Boy Advance SP and
Nintendo DS are backlit.

The Game Boy Player
accessory for Nintendo
GameCube outputs 480i
or 480p video.
----

to show relevant help.

The test suite is also
available for several
other consoles.

== Grid ==

This grid uses the screen's
full 240x160 pixel resolution.
Use it to verify that the
entire picture is visible,
including the red border,
with no distortion.

Select: Invert grays

== Linearity ==

This pattern shows five
circles at the square pixel
aspect ratio of the GBA
screen. The circles should
have the same diameter in
all directions.

Use it to verify the horizontal
to vertical size ratio setting
of a display or scaler or to
measure distortion on a CRT.

A: Hide or show grid
Select: Invert grays

== Convergence ==

Use these patterns to adjust
a CRT's color convergence.

Fine grid
↑↓: Change grid pattern
  (lines, dots, crosses)
Select: Invert grays
A: Go to colors

Color transition boundaries
↑↓: Hide or show
  black borders
A: Go to fine grid

== Gray ramp ==

Use this pattern to
check color balance.
This gray ramp should
not have a colored tint.

Cheap color LCDs may
have different gamma
curves per component.

== Solid color screen ==

Some displays and scalers
have problems with sudden
changes between deep black
and white. Others may have
stuck or damaged pixels.

←→: Change color among
  white, black, red,
  green, or blue
A on white: Hide or show
  RGB input
↑↓←→: Change RGB value
----
Poor high-voltage regulation
in a CRT causes image size
to depend on brightness.
This changes border width
on Game Boy Player.

== Motion blur ==

This tests how quickly an
LCD reacts to changes in
gray level by toggling a
square between two shades.
Use it with a high-speed
camcorder, or set the
shades the same to
check gray levels.

↑↓: Choose a setting
←→: Change its value
A: Start or stop the test
----
Like the Game Boy Color,
the Game Boy Advance
has a TFT display with
a decent response time.

All GB LCDs use row
inversion that can look
like interlace, drawing
even or odd lines darker
in alternate frames.

The Game Boy Player
accessory has a "Screen
Filter" effect that applies
a form of motion blur.

== Sharpness ==

Set the sharpness of your
TV to a value that shows
clean black and gray
transitions without white
ghost lines on the side.

Select: Invert grays
A: Toggle brick wall
----
Modern TVs' "sharpness"
control performs edge
enhancement, intended
for live action SDTV or
VHS sources.
Most TVs have zero as
no change and high as
enhancement. A few have
middle as no change,
high as enhancement,
and low as blurring.

== Overscan ==

Use this pattern to check
how much of the picture
edge your GBA's lens hides.

The LCD is recessed
in the chassis. This can
cast shadows on the
screen's edges depending
on the lighting angle.

↑↓←→: Choose an edge
A + ↑↓←→: Move edge
Select: Invert grays
----
Move each edge inward
until you see the border,
then go back one pixel. Or
leave one border pixel visible
and subtract 1. The result
is the amount of overscan
in pixels in each direction.

== Shadow sprite ==

This test draws a shadow
sprite on every other
frame, flickering at 30 Hz.
Many games use such flicker
to show transparency.

Some deinterlacers display
drop shadows correctly but
still interpret 240p as 480i.
The striped sprite should
make this easy to spot.
----
↑↓←→: Move sprite
A: Skip flicker frame
   or rotate stripes
A+↑: Change shadow type
   (flicker or stripes)
A+←→: Change background
Select: Change sprite shape

These shouldn't happen:
- Background loses detail
- Shadow disappears
- Thin horizontal stripes
  in flicker pattern
----
Faint stripes may appear
in the flicker pattern on a
GBA because its LCD uses
row inversion, drawing even
and odd lines with opposite
polarity to balance positive
and negative charge.

== Stopwatch ==

This stopwatch helps
you measure a TV's lag,
detect dropped frames,
time a workout, etc.

A: Start or stop
Select stopped: Reset
Select running: Lap
↑: Change ruler at left
   (show, hide, or blink)
↓: Hide or show
   inactive circles
----
The clock face below helps
determine the frame even
when the numbers above are
blurry.

The stopwatch assumes
60 Hz display, while the GBA
actually runs at 59.73 Hz.
This means it runs slightly
slow (1 part in 219).
----
To measure lag, get a
camera and connect two
displays to one GameCube.
One is being tested, and
the other (the reference)
should be a CRT SDTV or
a display with known lag.
For example, connect
a CRT and your scaler
using a cable with both
composite and S-Video out.
----
Then photograph both
screens at once.
The picture will show
the latency difference
between them. Some LCD
TVs exceed five frames.

The ruler helps count
scanlines of lag. Use a
short exposure on your
camera and divide lines by
15.7 to get milliseconds.
To avoid errors caused
by rolling shutter, put
the TVs side by side.

== Manual lag test ==

This helps quantify a
display's processing lag
by showing a changing
pattern on the screen,
optionally with audio.

Press A when the moving
and still reticles align
to display the offset in
frames from the actual
intersection. After ten
non-early presses,
their average is shown.
----
↑↓: Choose a setting
←→: Change its value

Settings include the direction
of the moving reticle, whether
to randomize timing of
movement, and whether to
beep when A is pressed
or beep and flash when
the reticles align.

== Hill zone scroll test ==

This shows a scrolling
background with several
parallax strips. It can
be used to notice any
drops in frame rate.

↑↓: Change speed
←→: Change direction
A: Start or stop

== Vertical scroll test ==

This test shows a
scrolling background.
Use it to measure
cadence detection in a
deinterlacer or row
inversion artifacts
in a handheld LCD.

↑↓: Change speed
←→: Change direction
A: Start or stop

== Grid scroll test ==

A grid scrolls vertically or
horizontally. Use it to test
linearity and how well the
display copes with scrolling
and frame rate. Some scalers
may produce a still image
at maximum speed.

↑↓: Change speed
A: Start or stop
A + ↑↓←→: Change direction
Select: Invert grays

== Full screen stripes ==

You should see a pattern of
lines, each one pixel wide.

↑↓←→: Move the pattern
  by one pixel
Hold ↑↓←→: Move every frame
A: Rotate stripes
Select: Show or hide
  frame counter
----
While you hold Up, the lines
should flicker. If holding
Up makes a still image, your
scaler is treating the signal
as interlaced and either
dropping or weaving frames.
A solid gray image indicates
slow LCD response time or
Game Boy Player filtering.

== Backlight zones ==

This test displays a small
moving square, letting
you check how a display
handles small bright areas.
Some LED-lit LCDs dim
dark areas to make blacks
deeper, which causes
problems with scenes such
as starfields and credits.

↑↓←→: Move the square
A: Hide or show the square
A+↑↓: Change its size among
  1, 2, 4, or 8 pixels on a side
Select: Invert grays

== Sound test: Frequency ==

8000 Hz
4000 Hz
2000 Hz
1000 Hz
500 Hz
250 Hz
125 Hz
62 Hz
1000 Hz left
1000 Hz right
1000 Hz (pulse)
Hiss noise
Buzz noise
G major (PCM)

== Sound test ==

Use this test to ensure
that the audio output
works and that audio and
video are synchronized.

A: Play a sound and
  flash the screen

All Game Boy systems output
stereo audio. Each voice
(pulse 1, pulse 2, wavetable,
and noise) can be panned
center or hard left or right.
Game Boy Advance adds
two 8-bit PCM channels.
----
Most choices use the
wavetable with an
approximate sine wave.
It has a prominent
overtone 5 octaves up.

The CPU generates noise
with a polynomial counter
in one of two modes:
hiss (32767 steps)
or buzz (127 steps).

The G chord is synthesized
in real-time using the
Karplus/Strong algorithm.

== Audio sync ==

This test flashes the
screen for two frames
and plays a tone when
the dot hits the floor.

You can verify sync
between audio and video
with recording equipment
or an oscilloscope.

A: Start or stop the test

== Lame boy ==

This test served as a
placeholder in early versions
of the Suite for tests not yet
ported to Game Boy Advance.
It's still cute.

←→: Move

== PLUGE ==

The PLUGE (picture line-up
generation equipment) pattern
is used to adjust the TV's
"brightness" or black level.
For most sources, lower the
brightness until the outer
bar is not visible, and slowly
raise it until it shows.
For GBA games, *mumbles
incoherent obscenities
about its dark screen*

A: Toggle levels between
   NTSC and NTSC-J
Select: Open PLUGE Contrast
----
GBA's 32 shades should
correspond to signal level
steps of about 3.2 IRE.
(This needs further testing.)
This would put shade 0 at
NTSC-J black (0 IRE) and
shade 2 near NTSC's 7.5 IRE
setup. PAL TV and US game
consoles also use 0 IRE.

NTSC: shades 3 and 0
  on background 2
NTSC-J: shades 1 and 0.5
  on background 0
----
The PLUGE Contrast
sub-test fills the screen
with a shark pictogram.
Use it with various
palettes to check
contrast and brightness.

A: Switch palette among color,
  dark, darker, light, or lighter
Select: Return to PLUGE

== Gradient color bars ==

Use this pattern to
calibrate colors on a TV.
Increase the contrast
(white level) until C and
E in the white ramp look
the same, then decrease
it slowly until you can
tell them apart.

A: Hide or show grid

== SMPTE color bars ==

Use this pattern to
calibrate for NTSC levels
regarding contrast,
brightness, and colors.
With some displays, you
can use blue-only mode
to confirm color balance.

Based on SMPTE EG 1-1990

A: Toggle brightness
  (75% or 100%)
Select: Play 1 kHz tone

== Color bars on gray ==

This pattern shows color
bars on a gray background.
Use it with color filters
to adjust color balance.

Based on Digital Video
Essentials: HD Basics

A: Toggle brightness
  (75% or 100%)
Select: Play 1 kHz tone

== Color bleed ==

Use this pattern to
diagnose color bleed
caused by incorrect
color resampling.

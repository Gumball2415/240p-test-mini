== About ==

The 240p Test Suite
has two goals:

1. Evaluate TV sets and
   video processors for
   ability to handle retro
   console video signals.
2. Turn a game console into
   a test signal generator
   to help in calibrating the
   black, white, and color
   levels of a display.
----
The Game Boy Advance
system outputs progressive
video with 160 lines of
picture. Its TFT panel has 32
levels per RGB channel and a
reputation for crushing black
levels, for which its launch
titles failed to compensate.
Game Boy Advance SP and
Nintendo DS are backlit.

The Game Boy Player
accessory for Nintendo
GameCube outputs 480i
or 480p video.
----
Press Start in any test
pattern to show help for
that pattern.

The test suite is also
available for several
other consoles.

== Grid ==

This grid uses the screen's
full 240x160 pixel resolution.
Use it to verify that the
entire picture is visible,
including the red border,
with no distortion.

Select: Invert grays

== Linearity ==

This pattern shows five
circles at the square pixel
aspect ratio of the GBA
screen. The circles should
have the same diameter in
all directions.

Use it to verify the horizontal
to vertical size ratio setting
of your display or scaler or
to verify the lack of barrel
distortion of a CRT.

A: Toggle grid
Select: Invert grays

== Gray ramp ==

Use this pattern to
check color balance.
This gray ramp should
not have a red, green,
or blue tint to it.

Cheap color LCDs may
have different gamma
curves per component.

== Solid screen ==

Some displays and scalers
have problems with sudden
changes between deep black
and a white screen.
Other displays may have
dead or damaged pixels.

←→: Change color among
  white, black, red,
  green, or blue
A on white: Toggle RGB
  input box
↑↓←→: Change RGB value
----
Poor high-voltage
regulation in a CRT
causes image size to
depend on brightness.
This causes the border
on Game Boy Player to
change width.

== Motion blur ==

This tests how quickly an
LCD reacts to changes in
gray level by toggling a
square between two shades.
Use it with a high-speed
camcorder, or set the
shades the same to
check gray levels.

↑↓: Choose a setting
←→: Change its value
A: Start/stop the test
----
Like the Game Boy Color,
the Game Boy Advance has
a TFT display with a decent
response time.

All Game Boy displays have
an interlace-like effect,
drawing even or odd lines
darker in alternate frames.

The Game Boy Player
accessory has a "Screen
Filter" effect that applies
a form of motion blur.

== Sharpness ==

Set the sharpness of your
TV to a value that shows
clean black and gray
transitions without white
ghost lines on the side.

Select: Invert grays
A: Toggle brick wall
----
Modern TVs' "sharpness"
control performs edge
enhancement, which is
designed for live action
SDTV or VHS sources.
Most TVs have zero as
no change and high as
enhancement. A few have
middle as no change,
high as enhancement,
and low as blurring.

== Overscan ==

With this pattern you
can discover how much
of the picture edge your
GBA's lens hides.

The LCD is slightly
recessed in the chassis.
This can block light from
reaching the screen's
edges depending on the
angle of the light source.
----
↑↓←→: Choose an edge
Hold A + ↑↓←→:
  Move that edge

Move each edge inward
until you see the border,
then go back one pixel. Or
leave one border pixel visible
and subtract 1. The result
is the amount of overscan
in pixels in each direction.

== Shadow sprite ==

This test draws a shadow
sprite on every other frame,
flickering at 30 Hz.
Many games use such flicker
to show transparency.

Some deinterlacers display
drop shadows correctly but
still interpret 240p as 480i.
The striped sprite should
make attempted deinterlacing
easy to spot.
----
↑↓←→: Move sprite
A: Skip flicker frame
  or rotate stripes
A+↑: Change shadow type
  (flicker or stripes)
A+←→: Change background
Select: Change sprite shape

These shouldn't happen:
- Background loses detail
- Shadow disappears
- Thin horizontal stripes
  in flicker pattern
----
Faint stripes may be visible
in the flicker pattern on a
GBA because its LCD circuit
uses a technique similar to
interlacing to improve pixel
response time.

== Stopwatch ==

This stopwatch helps you
measure a TV's lag, detect
dropped frames, or just
count how long your spouse
has been on the phone.

A: Start/stop
Select when stopped: Reset
Select when running: Lap
↑: Change ruler at left
   (show, hide, or show
   during even frames)
↓: Toggle inactive circles
----
The clock face below helps
determine the frame even
when the numbers above are
blurry.

The stopwatch assumes
60 Hz display, while the GBA
actually runs at 59.73 Hz.
This means it runs slightly
slow (1 part in 219).
----
To measure lag, get a
camera and connect two
displays to one GameCube.
One is being tested, and
the other (the reference)
should be a CRT SDTV or a
display with known lag.
For example, connect
a CRT and your scaler
using a cable with both
composite and S-Video out.
----
Then photograph both
screens at once. The picture
will show the difference in
image processing latency
between them. Some consumer
LCD TVs exceed five frames.

The ruler helps count
scanlines of lag. Use a
short exposure on your
camera and divide lines by
15.7 to get milliseconds.

== Manual lag test ==

This helps quantify a
display's processing lag
by showing a changing
pattern on the screen,
optionally with audio.

Press A when the moving
and still reticles align
to display the offset in
frames from the actual
intersection and whether
it was early or late. After
ten non-early presses,
their average is shown.
----
↑↓: Choose a setting
←→: Change its value

Settings include the
direction of the moving
reticle (horizontal,
vertical, or both),
whether to randomize
timing of movement, and
whether to beep when A
is pressed or beep and
flash when the reticles
align.

== Hill zone scroll test ==

This shows a scrolling
background with several
parallax strips. It can
be used to notice any
drops in frame rate.

↑↓: Change speed
←→: Change direction
A: Stop or start

== Vertical scroll test ==

This test shows a
scrolling background.
Use it to measure
cadence detection in a
deinterlacer or test
hypotheses about
handheld "interlacing".

↑↓: Change speed
←→: Change direction
A: Stop or start

== Grid scroll test ==

A grid scrolls vertically
or horizontally. This can
be used to test linearity
and how well the display
copes with scrolling and
frame rate. Some scalers
may produce a still image
at maximum speed.

↑↓: Change speed
A: Stop or start
A + ↑↓←→:
  Change direction
Select: Invert grays

== Full screen stripes ==

You should see a pattern of
lines, each one pixel wide.

↑↓←→: Move the pattern
  by one pixel
Hold ↑↓←→: Move every frame
A: Switch among horizontal,
  vertical, and checkerboard
Select: Show or hide
  frame counter
----
While you hold Up, the lines
should flicker. If holding
Up makes a still image, your
scaler is treating the signal
as interlaced and either
discarding every other frame
or weaving them incorrectly.

If holding Up makes a solid
gray image, you're seeing
slow LCD response time or
Game Boy Player filtering.

== Backlight zone test ==

This test displays a small
moving square, letting you
check how a display works
with small bright areas.
Some LED-lit LCDs dim
darker areas to make black
areas darker, which causes
problems with scenes such
as starfields and credits.

↑↓←→: Move the square
A: Hide or show the square
A+↑↓: Change its size among
  1, 2, 4, or 8 pixels on a side
Select: Invert grays

== Sound test: Frequency ==

8000 Hz
4000 Hz
2000 Hz
1000 Hz
500 Hz
250 Hz
125 Hz
62 Hz
1000 Hz left
1000 Hz right
1000 Hz (pulse)
Hiss noise
Buzz noise
G major (PCM)

== Sound test ==

Use this test to ensure
that the audio output
works and that audio and
video are synchronized.

A: Play a sound and
  flash the screen

The Game Boy has stereo
audio output. Each voice
(pulse 1, pulse 2, wavetable,
and noise) can be panned
center or hard left or right.
The Game Boy Advance adds
two 8-bit PCM channels.
----
Most options in the menu
use the wavetable with
an approximate sine wave.
It has a prominent overtone
5 octaves up.

The CPU generates noise
with a polynomial counter
in one of two modes:
hiss (32767 steps)
or buzz (127 steps).

The G chord is synthesized
in real-time using the
Karplus/Strong algorithm.

== Audio sync test ==

This test flashes the
whole screen for two
frames along with a
1 kHz test tone when
the dot hits the floor.

You can verify the sync
between audio and video
with recording equipment
or an oscilloscope.

A: Start/stop the test

== Lame boy ==

This test serves as a
placeholder in early versions
of 160p Test Suite for tests
that have not yet been ported
to Game Boy Advance.
It's still cute.

←→: Move

== PLUGE ==

The PLUGE (picture line-up
generation equipment) pattern
is used to adjust the TV's
"brightness" or black level.
For most sources, lower the
brightness until the outer
bar is not visible, and slowly
raise it until it shows.
For GBA games, *mumbles
incoherent obscenities
about its dark screen*

A: Toggle levels between
  NTSC and NTSC-J
Select: Open PLUGE Contrast
----
GBA's 32 shades should
correspond to signal level
steps of about 3.2 IRE.
(This needs further testing.)
This would put shade 0 at
NTSC-J black (0 IRE) and
shade 2 near NTSC's 7.5 IRE
setup. PAL TV and US game
consoles also use 0 IRE.

NTSC: shades 3 and 0
  on background 2
NTSC-J: shades 1 and 0.5
  on background 0
----
PLUGE Contrast

This sub test fills the screen
with a pattern based on the
SHARK (U+1F988) emoji.
Use it with various palettes
to check contrast and
brightness.

A: Switch palette among color,
  dark, darker, light, or lighter
Select: Return to PLUGE

== Gradient color bars ==

This pattern lets you
calibrate red, green, and
blue colors on your TV.
Increase the "contrast"
(white level) until C and
E in the white ramp look
the same, then decrease
it slowly until you can
tell them apart.

A: Toggle grid

== SMPTE color bars ==

Use this pattern to
calibrate for NTSC levels
regarding contrast,
brightness, and colors.
With some displays, you
can use blue-only mode
to confirm color balance.

Based on SMPTE EG 1-1990

A: Toggle brightness
  (75% or 100%)
Select: Play 1 kHz tone

== Color bars on gray ==

This pattern shows color
bars on a gray background.
Use it with color filters
to adjust color balance.

Based on Digital Video
Essentials: HD Basics

A: Toggle brightness
  (75% or 100%)
Select: Play 1 kHz tone

== Color bleed ==

This pattern helps
diagnose color bleed
caused by incorrect
color resampling.
